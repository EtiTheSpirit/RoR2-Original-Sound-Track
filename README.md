## TODO write a better readme

An overhaul of [EtiTheSpirt's fork](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/RoR2-Original-Sound-Track/tree/master) of [Kyle Paulsen's OriginalSoundTrack mod](https://github.com/kylepaulsen/RoR2-Original-Sound-Track).

The following improvements were made:

- the settings file has been rewritten in json
- prevented a game freeze when switching tracks
- added logging to help debug issues with the settings file, only enabled when there is no log yet
- implemented getting volume from the ingame sliders
- added all scenes since 1.5.2024 to the settings file

Should be pretty straightforward to use, just have a look at settings.json. For more information, visit [Kyle Paulsen's OriginalSoundTrack mod](https://github.com/kylepaulsen/RoR2-Original-Sound-Track).
